It is known that the amount of data generated has been increasingly tremendous in the past few years due to 
Covid-19 pandemic, the ease of accessing the internet and cheap or inexpensive mass storage devices. The ease 
of transferring data through internet, communication lines and digital data are used in all walks of life. 
Nowadays, these big data have been used for data mining, knowledge discovery, machine learning, statistical 
learning, statistical analysis and experiments. In order to extract or discover useful data, information or 
knowledge from these big data, one of the methods we usually adopted is the optimal samples selection.  
 
In this group project, you are expected to extract a subset of samples from these big data. In order to extract this 
subset of data (samples), we have to make sure that the subset of samples extracted or selected should be as fair 
and unbiased as possible and also as optimal as possible. In the following we propose a useful method.  
 
Assuming that there are m samples (45<=m<=54), any group of n (7<=n<=25) samples out of these m samples are 
randomly selected. There are mCn  groups of n samples. From one of these groups of n samples, we randomly 
select e.g., k=6 (4<=k<=7) samples to form some groups. So there will be nCk  groups of k=6 samples selected. 
Among these groups of k=6 samples, we would like to optimize them by selecting ONLY some of them. The 
conditions that need to be fulfilled are listed as follows: 
1. There are at least ONE group of k samples, in which s (3<=s<=7) samples have been selected from the j 
(where s<=j<=k) samples, i.e., when j=4, we have s=3 or 4; when j=5, we have s=3, 4 or 5; when j=6, we 
have s=3, 4, 5 or 6; and when j=7, we have s=3, 4, 5, 6 or 7. 
 
E.g. 1, when m=45, n=7 (we randomly choose 7 samples, A,B,C,D,E,F,G and k=6, j=5, s=5, we obtain the 
following minimum 6 groups of k=6 samples, which guarantee at least ONE group of k=6 samples has ALL 
s=5 samples groups from ALL j=5 samples groups of n=7 samples,(i.e.,nCj=7C5 and jCs =5C5).

the following minimum 7 groups of k=6 samples, which guarantees at least ONE group of k=6 samples has 
ALL s=4 samples groups from ALL j=4 samples groups of n=8 samples, (i.e., nCj=8C4 and jCs=4C4).

2.  A user friendly interface should be provided. A system title is given as, e.g., “An Optimal Samples Selection System”.  
3.  The user needs to input the values for parameters m, n, k, j and s. They are all positive integers. See Screens below. 
4.  The system can either randomly select n out of m numbers or a user can input n out of m numbers, and displays these 
n numbers on screen. 
5. Output groups of k=6 samples (results) to a DB file, e.g., 40-9-6-4-4-x-y for m=40, n=9, k=6, j=s=4 for the xth run 
and y is the number of results obtained. 
6.  Provide a way to EXECUTE and DELETE, etc. the obtained groups of k samples (results) onto the screen from a 
DB file, e.g., 45-9-6-4-4-x-y.These groups of k=6 samples are selected from the list. Please see the screens below.
